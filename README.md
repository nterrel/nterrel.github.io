I wanted to build a website, so I did.

## Current structure

- `index.html` — single-page site with tabbed sections (this might change later)
- `styles.css` — all of the site styling is contained here
- `assets/` — images and other static assets (e.g. headshot)

Using Prettier to auto-format html.
