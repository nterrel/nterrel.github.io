        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about">
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              I am a computational chemist with a passion for developing tools to
              accelerate scientific discovery. I specialize in machine learning
              interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and their application to ultra-large-scale
              molecular dynamics simulations of reactive chemical systems, earning me a
              PhD in Chemistry from the University of Florida in 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's hard to pinpoint when I got my start, but if I had to pick an exact
              moment, it would be when I was seven years old playing Sly Cooper on my
              PlayStation 2. This semi-open-world game had me exploring the boundary
              conditions of the game world and playing around with the physics the game
              modeled. That simple life experience led me down a path of loving video
              games and having a constant curiosity about the way physics are implemented
              in those virtual worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward several years to my college years, I found myself studying
              chemistry and astronomy, where I learned that I could combine my love for
              understanding the natural world with programming and how we can use
              computational tools to solve massive challenges in the sciences. I joined
              Dr. Bill Miller's research lab at Truman State University, where I proposed
              my own project: Simulating selective water filtration using functionalized
              carbon nanotubes. This project introduced me to molecular dynamics, system
              design, and learning the ropes of high-performance computing and scripting.
            </p>
            <p>
              This lead to my graduate studies at the University of Florida in the lab of
              Dr. Adrian Roitberg, where I developed frameworks for training and deploying
              machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate large-scale
              molecular dynamics simulations of complex chemical systems. In my first
              meeting with Dr. Roitberg, he showed me a simulation of carbon atoms
              assembling into graphene sheets, and I was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, I've worked on a variety of projects, from simulating prebiotic
              chemistry to developing tools for uncertainty quantification in machine
              learning potentials. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals,
              and I've been lucky to present my research at several conferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest passion in life is learning; if you tell me something new and
              intriguing, you can bet that I'll open up a new tab as a starting point to
              research more deeply later. Outside of that, I enjoy hiking, comic books,
              playing video games, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
              (especially ones that earn me compliments from my partner).

              >Served as a recruitment ambassador for the University of Florida,
              Department of Chemistry to help prospective graduate students learn about
              research opportunities and see the benefits of joining the UF Chemistry
              community. <br /><br />
              I also served as a recruitment ambassador at Truman State University,
              sending admissions acceptance packages, conducting campus tours, and hosting
              prospective students during open house events.

              >I have a passion for mentoring and supporting early-career researchers. I
              have provided guidance on Python workflows for computational chemistry and
              HPC, including debugging, environment setup, and best practices for
              reproducible research. <br /><br />
              There is something about making complex topics "click" for someone that is
              less-than-technical that I find deeply rewarding. Perhaps it is due to my
              own experiences as a self-taught programmer coming from a non-traditional
              background.
